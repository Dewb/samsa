# samsa

Samsa is a script for iii arc that emulates a 16n; four pages of four high-resolution MIDI CC parameters, with 14-bit MSB/LSB support. 

The key cycles through the four pages. on each dial, a gradient shows the macro value of the parameter (top six bits), while a small indicator shows the low six bits.
